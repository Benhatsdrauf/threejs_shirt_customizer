# Welcome to the ThreeJS Shirt Customizer!

Hi! This is a cool little project using **ThreeJS** and also **DALL.E** for customizing a shirt.

I took inspiration from **JavaScrip Mastery** and tried to build it myself.

I am thinking about extending the functionality of this small project in the future, but for now i am pleased it works so well.

In this application you can customize a 3D-Model of a shirt by changing its color, the logo or a texture for the whole shirt.

You can either upload a picture from your PC or you can ask your little AI friend (DALL.E) to create a logo or a texture for your shirt.

Just have fun and try it out for a little bit and i hope you will have as much fun fiddling arround as i had building it.

Just dont overdo it... i only have the free plan so i cant generate unlimited images :D
